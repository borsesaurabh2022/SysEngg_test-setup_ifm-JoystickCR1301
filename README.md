## SysEngg_test-setup_ifm-JoystickCR1301
 This package consists of software developed to demonstrate the functionality of IFM CR1301Joystick. It consists of project requirement documentation which delineates the user-specific requirements, use cases, and block definitions. The system consists of a microcontroller ESP32 and CAN control module MCP2515, more information about the used hardware can be referred from project documentation. 
 
## Project description
• A system developed for an industry-grade joystick if-CR1301 with the ability to control the different operating modes listed below based on user inputs. Inbuilt LEDs were used for visual representation of these modes. 

• Implemented three modes: Default mode, Change Color, and Automatic Illumination Mode.

• Used CAN communication protocol SAE J1939 to send and receive data between the joystick and the embedded controller (ESP-32) using a CAN controller module (MCP 2515).

• System was developed using a systematic approach - System Engineering, firstly project scope was finalized with requirement documentation and subdivided into functional and non-functional requirements, followed by detailed architecture using use cases diagram and block diagram. The software stack was realized with a systematic sequence diagram and state machine diagram.
